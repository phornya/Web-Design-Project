            <div class="flex_content">
                <h3>1. Choose the Right Platform</h3>
                <p>Select a reputable telemedicine platform that offers services relevant to your needs, whether it's
                    general consultations, specialist appointments, or mental health services. Check reviews, data
                    security policies, and available features.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Prepare for Your Appointment</h3>
                <p>Make a list of symptoms, medications, and any questions you have before the appointment. This helps
                    you maximize the time with the provider and ensures all your concerns are addressed.</p>
                <h3>3. Check for Insurance Compatibility</h3>
                <p>Confirm if your health insurance covers telemedicine and if the specific platform or provider is
                    in-network. This can save you on out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
                <h3>4. Set Up a Quiet, Private Space</h3>
                <p>Find a quiet spot for your appointment to discuss your health openly. Make sure you have a stable
                    internet connection, good lighting, and any documents you might need. <br>
                    If you're busy or prefer flexibility, consider doctors who offer telemedicine services or virtual
                    consultations, especially for follow-ups. Telemedicine is particularly helpful for ongoing health
                    management without needing to visit in person every time.</p>
                <h3>5. Follow-Up and Prescriptions</h3>
                <p>If your provider prescribes medication, confirm the details of the prescription and ask about options
                    for e-prescriptions to make it easier to fill them. Many platforms offer in-app messaging for
                    follow-up questions.</p>
