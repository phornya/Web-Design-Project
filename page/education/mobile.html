                <p>Conduct surveys or collaborate with local leaders to identify areas where access to vaccines is
                    limited. <br>
                    ssess the demographic and geographic factors that could impact demand and logistics.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Location and Scheduling</h3>
                <p>Choose locations that are central and accessible, such as schools, community centers, parks, and
                    workplaces.</p>
                <h3>3. Staffing and Training</h3>
                <p>Ensure staff members are trained in both vaccination protocols and community engagement. <br>
                    Prepare your team to handle common questions and address any concerns about vaccines.</p>
                <h3>4. Equipment and Supplies</h3>
                <p>Equip your vehicle with portable refrigeration units to maintain vaccine potency. <br>
                    Carry enough personal protective equipment (PPE), disinfectants, and emergency medical supplies.</p>
                <h3>5. Efficient Record-Keeping</h3>
                <p>Use digital tools if possible for on-the-spot registration and updating health records. <br>
                    Implement a system to securely track doses administered and follow-up appointments if needed.</p>
