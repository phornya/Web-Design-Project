            <div class="flex_content">
                <h3>1. Design Family-Friendly Waiting Areas</h3>
                <p>Comfortable Seating: Provide spacious, comfortable seating that can accommodate multiple family
                    members and allow them to be close together.
                    Entertainment Options: Include books, magazines, charging stations, and toys or tablets for
                    children. Consider a family-friendly TV area with content for all ages. <br>
                    Separate Child-Friendly Spaces: If possible, offer a designated area within the waiting room for
                    children, equipped with kid-safe furniture, toys, and engaging wall art or activity stations to help
                    kids stay occupied.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Flexible Visiting Policies</h3>
                <p>Extended Visiting Hours: Allow flexible or extended visiting hours, especially for pediatric,
                    maternity, and intensive care units, to help families spend more time with their loved ones. <br>
                    Family Accommodations: In cases where a family member needs to stay overnight, offer recliners,
                    sleeping chairs, or nearby family rooms for comfort. Consider providing cots or blankets if space
                    allows.</p>
                <h3>3. Support Services for Families</h3>
                <p>Social Work and Counseling: Provide access to social workers, counselors, or support groups to help
                    families cope with stress, anxiety, and difficult decisions. <br>
                    Patient and Family Liaisons: Assign family liaisons or patient advocates who can help families
                    navigate the hospital system, understand medical information, and coordinate with staff on their
                    needs.</p>
                <h3>4. Provide Family Resources and Information</h3>
                <p>DEducational Materials: Ofer brochures, videos, or digital resources to educate families about the
                    patient's condition, hospital procedures, and ways they can support their loved one's recovery. <br>
                    Guided Hospital Tours: Especially in maternity or pediatric departments, offer guided tours so
                    families know what to expect and can feel more comfortable.</p>
                <h3>5. Create a Child-Friendly Environment</h3>
                <p>Pediatric-Specific Design: For children's hospitals or departments, design spaces with bright colors,
                    fun murals, and familiar characters to create a calming, welcoming environment for kids. <br>
                    Interactive Waiting Rooms: Some hospitals add interactive elements, like touch screens or wall
                    games, in pediatric waiting rooms to reduce anxiety and keep children engaged.</p>
